	<h2>The Flash</h2>

	<p>I like the flash series because it deals with future science. Like Time travel, teleportation and many superhumans. The main characters are amazing and play their role nicely. The show is also realistic. In the beggining it shows how Barry really wasnt superhero material until later on he gets used to his powers.</p>
	<h1>Spongebob Squarepants</h1>

	<p>I like Spongebob tv show because it brings alot of humour and the characters are all friends. So you wouldnt know why any of them would be mad at each other unless its squidward and spongebob</p>
